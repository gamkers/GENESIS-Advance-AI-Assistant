Advanced AI Assistant is a the improved version of the existing model of 
virtual assistant. AI virtual assistant such as “Siri, Google assistant, Alexa” 
have become part of our daily life. But most of the virtual assistants are not 
capable of more advanced process such as Network security, professional uses
and more.

The growth in AI technologies will be the future of modern welfare. We can 
make AI as a Professional AI system that is more powerful and efficient by 
combining multiple domains. So, the professional AI system is made for
professionals to assist the user with their professional tasks , like .providing 
predicted stock and crypto price for traders to get clarity on the investment and
to gain profits from the investment they made from our predicted values of price 
, providing security in networking for better privacy of an individual, scrapping
a particular data from the internet and providing valuable information to the 
user to make their daily life much easier(live news from top articles, getting 
information about offers in e-commerce websites, surfing through internet),
Open Source Intelligence(OSINT is the method of collecting and analyzing 
data or information of something that already exist or openly available in the 
internet) for example gathering information about a person using username
available in the social media network.

In this project we have developed an AI assistant that can perform advanced 
tasks that are not performed by any other existing virtual assistant models till 
now. To create a professional Assistant, that can perform Advanced Task like
Machine Learning, Network security, Extract data directly from the internet to
provide valuable information to the user. In Future this project will made as an 
end product were user can directly interact with the AI
